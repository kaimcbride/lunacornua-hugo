[{"categories":["Kai's Photo Topic"],"contents":"PLEASE JOIN LIVE ZOOM: Saturday May 2nd, 7pm Eastern. The history of photography is full of great examples of photographers that left the comfort of home to seek out the wider world with their camera tucked under their arm. In the United States the bedrock was set by Walker Evans\u0026rsquo; book American Photographs, which the young Robert Frank studied while embarking on what became The Americans. However, for every great outing by a keen eyed native (Evans) or enchanted foreigner (Frank), there are multitudes of photographers who came back with nothing but failures. I know that I have stories of being on both ends of this spectrum.\nIn addition to my presentation I\u0026rsquo;ve asked a couple of people to speak about recent bodies of work they have made while traveling, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that you can add an anecdote or two as well.\nClick this link to JOIN ZOOM MEETING\n","permalink":"http://lunacornua.com/traveling-to-photograph/","tags":null,"title":"Traveling to Photograph: Rewards and Pitfalls"},{"categories":["Kai's Photo Topic"],"contents":"   Recording from April 25th: This week\u0026rsquo;s topic, which I promise will not just be a pedantic drubbing of film or digital, but an exploration of reasons why an artist-photographer might choose one over the other (or both, is it possible to be agnostic???). Is it all just a belief system, or are their compelling reasons to keep shooting film? What does it mean for younger photographers who started out in the digital age? Why did you switch to digital, or why won\u0026rsquo;t you? Digital tools enabling a photographer a more painterly practice?\nStructure of the talk: - COMMERCIAL / EDITORIAL - TECHNICAL QUALITIES - ROLE IN EDUCATION - ROLE IN CULTURE - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM PHOTOGRAPHY? - DISCIPLINE VS PRACTICE - PRINTS: PHOTOGRAPHS VS INKJET PRINTS - COST: $$$ AND TIME - NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS - DIGITAL IS EASIER / LIMITLESS - NOT EQUIVALENT - THE ZEN OF THE DARKROOM - POSITIVE BENEFITS - PRESSURE TO SEEM RELEVANT / CURRENT - PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE - DRECK OF THE SELF-CONSCIENCE DEATH OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

I\u0026rsquo;ve assembled some examples from over two dozen photographers who made work about their home life: portraits of family; still life; staged conceptual practice; diaristic; and combinations all in between. All prompts for a conversation about work like this that provided a profound connection and inspiration, our own attempts to point the camera within the walls of home. Why/When/How does a photograph work as more than a memento? Do you need a photogenic family?\n","permalink":"http://lunacornua.com/domestic-focus/","tags":null,"title":"Domestic Focus: The Photographer at Home"},{"categories":["Kai's Photo Topic"],"contents":"   Recording from April 11th: This week\u0026rsquo;s topic explores the relationship between the photographer and the cameras they choose to employ.
