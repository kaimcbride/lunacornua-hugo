Recording from April 25th: This week's topic, which I promise will not just be
a pedantic drubbing of film or digital, but an exploration of reasons why an artist-photographer
might choose one over the other (or both, is it possible to be agnostic???).
Is it all just a belief system, or are their compelling reasons to keep shooting film?
What does it mean for younger photographers who started out in the
digital age? Why did you switch to digital, or why won't you? Digital tools enabling a
photographer a more painterly practice?

Structure of the talk:
- COMMERCIAL / EDITORIAL 
- TECHNICAL QUALITIES
- ROLE IN EDUCATION
- ROLE IN CULTURE
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM PHOTOGRAPHY?
- DISCIPLINE VS PRACTICE
- PRINTS: PHOTOGRAPHS VS INKJET PRINTS
- COST: $$$ AND TIME
- NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS
- DIGITAL IS EASIER / LIMITLESS
- NOT EQUIVALENT
- THE ZEN OF THE DARKROOM
- POSITIVE BENEFITS
- PRESSURE TO SEEM RELEVANT / CURRENT
- PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE
- DRECK OF THE SELF-CONSCIENCE DEATH OF PHOTOGRAPHY. AESTHETICS OF THE ANALOG PROCESS.
- NEW PRACTITIONERS. ETCHING
- THE INTEGRATED APPROACH
- BELIEF SYSTEM AND CHARACTER
