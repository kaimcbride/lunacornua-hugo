An appreciative look at the work made by the eminent curator before and after his time at MoMA. Most of us first saw
and tried to decipher that tongue twister of a last name when coming across his writings in
one of the MoMA catalogs (for me it was reading his descriptions of Atget's photographs). 

But who was the photographer, already a two-time Guggenheim Fellow, that landed that job
at MoMA in 1962? With the large gap between bodies of work, what does it mean to give
your creative energy over to something larger than yourself, and how might that be something
those of us who teach need to keep at heart?

Note: Even among people who counted him as a friend or worked with him for
years pronounce the last name slightly differently. I've settled on <br>_"Shar-coff-ski"_ based
on how a close friend of his always pronounces it.
