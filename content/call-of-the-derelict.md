This week's subject is one that has come up a few times on previous topics, and I was reminded of these ideas when asked to look at the work of Gabriele Basilico's photographs of worn-torn Beirut. I'm talking about the siren song that has seduced many a photographer, myself included, "The Call of the Derelict, Timeworn, & Weather-Beaten". 

What draws us to these subjects? The urge to memorialize the past; the undeniable photogenic quality of a well-used textured surface;  hoping to address loss, tragedy, and memory? And where does the "ruin porn" of photo-tourists being lead through old factory buildings in Detroit fit into this? I don't think it's as simple, or as easily dismissible as we might first think. 

Worthy of a discussion.

__Shameless Plugs__<br>
I'll be hosting a conversation with the photographer [Eileen Quinlan](http://eileenquinlan.com) as part of StudelMediaLive's Photo Talks. These are live on Zoom and have a suggested donation which goes towards the charity Migrant Kitchen. __Friday June 5th at 2pm Eastern__. [Details on the series can be found here](https://strudelmedialive.com/phototalks).

Speaking of StrudelMediaLive, I am teaching a class [Photobook Intensive: Structure and Meaning](https://strudelmedialive.com/classes/photobook-intensive-structure-and-meaning) there that begins June 11th and runs for 4 weeks. Click the link for details.
