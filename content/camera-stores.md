The professional camera store, a central place to every photographer, is often glossed over when talking about photography's evolution. These aren't just places you can go to see the latest equipment, pickup some used gear, or restock on supplies, but also where the fashion photographer, museum showing artist, and first semester student can meet at the counter. The local professional camera store has been struggling, like all brick and mortar stores, to stay relevant in the era of online ordering, but the recent pandemic has been another blow. I've invited [Ross Kasovitz from K&M Camera](http://kmcamera.com) and [Jeff Hirsch from Foto Care](http://fotocare.com) to talk about their amazing stores in Manhattan (both stores are open for business, btw!).

For more in depth information about Jeff Hirsch and Peter Kasovitz (Ross's father who founded K&M), I highly recommend listening the the interviews Michael Chovan-Dalton did with them on his __Real Photo Show__ podcast.
