[PLEASE JOIN LIVE ZOOM: Saturday May 2nd, 7pm Eastern](http://bit.ly/KPT-May2). 
The history of photography is full of great examples of photographers that left the
comfort of home to seek out the wider world with their camera tucked under their
arm. In the United States the bedrock was set by Walker Evans' book American Photographs, 
which the young Robert Frank studied while embarking on what became The Americans.
However, for every great outing by a keen eyed native (Evans) or enchanted foreigner (Frank),
there are multitudes of photographers who came back with nothing but failures.
I know that I have stories of being on both ends of this spectrum.

In addition to my presentation I've asked a couple of people to speak about recent bodies
of work they have made while traveling, and I'm hoping that you can add an anecdote or
two as well.
