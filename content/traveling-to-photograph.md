The history of photography is full of great examples of photographers that left the
comfort of home to seek out the wider world with their camera tucked under their
arm. In the United States the bedrock was set by Walker Evans' book American Photographs, 
which the young Robert Frank studied while embarking on what became The Americans.
However, for every great outing by a keen eyed native (Evans) or enchanted foreigner (Frank),
there are multitudes of photographers who came back with nothing but failures.
I know that I have stories of being on both ends of this spectrum.

The structure of my presentation is broken into these sections:<br>
Exploration and Photography <br>
The Artist on the Road in the USA<br>
The Heroâ€™s Journey<br>
Rewards<br>
Pitfalls<br>

In addition to my presentation I've asked a couple of friends to speak about recent bodies
of work they have made while traveling.

__Yola Monakhov-Stockton__ spoke about work she's been making in Hawai'i, photographing
family and working with an archive she found there. She also touches upon how her
sense of what constitutes home was complicated by her emigration from Russia when she was young.
Later in the talk she dives into questions surrounding ethical considerations when photographing away from home.

__Nat Ward__ spoke about his experience working on a long-term project in Florida that wound
up not working out, and how letting go of preconceived notions of what to expect from
where you are traveling can allow the place to reveal itself. Nat has a recently
published book, Big Throat, of photographs and writing from an existential experience 
on the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in New Mexico. Information about the book can be seen on the
publisher's website: [Big Throat](https://www.krisgravesprojects.com/book/bigthroat).

__Patrice Helmar__ shared some quotes that gave her guidance in the past when thinking
about traveling away from home to photograph. She spoke about class issues that 
are tied up with who gets to travel and where, and how her inherent curiosity about
people contributes to strangers opening up their homes to her. Some of these
portraits can be found on the _Down by Law_ section of her site. Please visit
