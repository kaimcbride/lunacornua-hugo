Recording from April 18th: This week's topic is plucked straight from the zeitgeist, and a popular subject among curators and museums right now in this time of sheltering-at-home. I've assembled some examples from over two dozen photographers who made work about their home life: portraits of family; still life; staged conceptual practice; diaristic; and combinations all in between. All prompts for a conversation about work like this that provided a profound connection and inspiration, our own attempts to point the camera within the walls of home. Why/When/How does a photograph work as more than a memento? Do you need a photogenic family?
